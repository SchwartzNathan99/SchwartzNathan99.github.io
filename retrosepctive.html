        <p>
            I still have a long way to go to pursue industry jobs in areas such as Web Development. Some listings, such as <a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5df5f41c480f6227&from=shareddesktop"> this one</a>, demonstrates a wide array of preferred requirements for prospective employees. Common requirements include familiarity with JavaScript, JSON, TypeScript, C#, HTML, RESTful Web APIs, SQL Server and Microsoft Azure. I have familiarity with all of these at varying capacities, though my experience with Microsoft Azure and using RESTful Web APIs is minimal.
        </p>
        <p>   
            Many jobs prefer experience, which I am currently pursuing through internships, though entry level jobs may be an option after graduation to further gain familiarity. One of the listings I viewed preferred 4+ years of experience, so it’s clear that experience is incredibly valuable. My internship with Brown & Brown Insurance in 2023 allowed me to gain some experience with SQL and Microsoft Azure, as well as PowerBI. This internship is still one of the most valuable points on my resume, as it gave me real world experience.
        </p>

            Outside of hands-on experience, I can also practice through personal projects and self-education through online resources. There are many online sites and courses as well as YouTube videos that provide insights on many topics and skills that would be useful for Web Development. I’ve been able to make use of sites such as LinkedIn Learning that provide tutorials and courses from experts. Even if practical experience is more valuable, self-study certainly provides a head start.
